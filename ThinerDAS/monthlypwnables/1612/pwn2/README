The author have accumulated an adequate amount of C++ codes, and taking one out as a pwning challenge is easy. The hard part is to solve it. An unsolvable challenge is of no value, and so is a trivially solved challenge.

The idea for the challenge (at least, the intended solution) is so interesting that XNUCA has adopted this trick in one of its hardest challenges in the coming week. (Yes, I feel honored for that.)

However, I believe that if it is you guys, then it will be solved eventually.

TRIVIA:

As you might expect, you can actually run this and it will terrifyingly match with the oj (that is, having full 1000 scores on every test case):

socat EXEC:"./oj 0" EXEC:"./aipf"
socat EXEC:"./oj 1" EXEC:"./aipf"
socat EXEC:"./oj 2" EXEC:"./aipf"
socat EXEC:"./oj 3" EXEC:"./aipf"

where ./oj is the OJ for the XNUCA challenge in October, named pattern-finder.
